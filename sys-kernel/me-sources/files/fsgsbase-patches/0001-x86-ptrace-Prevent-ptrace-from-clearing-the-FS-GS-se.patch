Subject: [PATCH 01/18] x86/ptrace: Prevent ptrace from clearing the FS/GS
 selector

When a ptracer writes a ptracee's FS/GS base with a different value, the
selector is also cleared. While this behavior is incorrect as the selector
should be preserved, most userspace applications did not notice that as
they do not use non-zero segments to begin with.

Instead, with this patch, when a tracee sets the base we will let it do
so without clearing the selector.

The change above means that a tracee that already has a selector set
will fail in an attempt to set the base - the change won't stick and the
value will be instead based on the value of the selector. As with the
above, we haven't found userspace that would be affected by this change.
